Creating a landing page that will help me practice how to use flexbox and using CSS to style my HTML.

Got it as close as I could. It was good practice using flexbox and adding styles to the text.
The hardest part was getting some of the styles to look like the pictures but that just might be me trying to get it as perfect as I could.
